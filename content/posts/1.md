Making use of the lockdown time, I have spent some time to update my
homepage. I was bored in dealing directly with html/css. After some
research on the tools for making a static website, I narrowed down to
the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). I prefer static website to dynamic
webstie, as I will never have any dynamic content. After spending some
time exploring the themes, I have finalized on Hermit theme. Some
customization was needed.
